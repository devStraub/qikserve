	-> 8 hours.
	-> An interface for integrate with API, integration tests and more unitary tests.

2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that
shows how you've used it.
	-> I´m use java 17. 
	-> I didn't use anything new. Why complicate it? Simple is the best.

Questions
Written and verbal communication skills play a pivotal role in our culture and are key to success within our organization. Some individuals
excel in written communication, while others shine in verbal interactions. We believe in providing you with an opportunity to demonstrate
proficiency in both areas.
Select one of the questions below and submit your answer before your interview!
1. Share a recent judgment call you've made within the past 12 months that couldn't be thoroughly analyzed beforehand. Focus on a
business-related issue. Whether it was a significant decision or a smaller one, describe the situation, the alternatives you considered,
and your decision-making process. Explain why you chose the judgment call you did over the alternatives.

	-> In the past 12 months, I faced a situation where I had to make an important decision without being able to fully analyze the data. 
	We were implementing a new project management system, but midway through the process, an unforeseen issue arose: the team had to decide 
	whether to continue with the tool that had been partially implemented or switch to an alternative that seemed more promising. 
	The decision was critical, as switching tools at that point would mean delays and additional costs.

	I gathered the IT team and project managers to discuss the options. The tool we were using offered security since it had already been partially implemented, 
	but its limited functionalities could present future challenges. The alternative offered more advanced features, greater scalability, 
	and easy integration with other tools we were already using, but it would require more time for adaptation.

	I chose to go with the new tool, even though I knew it would cause a short delay. My decision was based on long-term potential and feedback from the team about the new tool's ease of use. 
	In the end, the transition was smoother than expected, and the decision proved to be the right one: we successfully implemented a more robust and efficient system with greater flexibility for future adjustments. 
	This decision turned out to be valuable in terms of both productivity and team satisfaction, as they are now using a modern and integrated solution.

2. Describe the most innovative or inventive endeavor you've undertaken. This could be your idea for a process change, a new product
concept, a unique metric, or a novel customer interface. Do not share confidentail information! Provide context to help us understand the
innovation. What problem were you addressing, and what were the outcomes? Why was solving this problem important, and what was
the impact of the change?

	-> One of the most innovative projects I've worked on recently was the creation of a unique metric to monitor the operational efficiency of our customer support teams. 
	Previously, our performance metrics were fragmented and did not accurately reflect the customer experience, making it difficult to make decisions for improvements.

	I identified the need to consolidate these metrics into a single indicator that would truly show the impact of customer support. I developed the idea of a "Customer Support Efficiency Index" (CSEI), 
	which combined variables such as response time, first-contact resolution, and customer feedback. The biggest challenge was finding a fair balance between these metrics so that the index would be realistic and applicable.

	I implemented the CSEI as a real-time dashboard for support leadership. The innovation brought almost immediate results: the team became more aware of how small improvements in response time or direct problem resolution affected the overall index, 
	resulting in more focused performance. The impact was a 20% reduction in the average resolution time and a significant increase in customer satisfaction. 
	This change was crucial for our continuous growth, as it enabled quick and efficient adaptation to customer needs.
